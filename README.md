# March Madness 2023 - Historical Analysis üèÄüìä

[![Streamlit App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Streamlit-App-brightgreen)](https://marchmadness23.streamlit.app/)

This repository contains the code and resources for a statistical analysis project focused on the 2023 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. It served as a foundational step towards more advanced simulations and analyses, which have been significantly expanded in the [March Madness 2025](https://github.com/nehat312/march-madness-2025) project.

**Note:** This project is primarily for historical reference and demonstration. For the latest features, including bracket simulations and enhanced analytics, please refer to the [March Madness 2025](https://github.com/nehat312/march-madness-2025) repository.

## Overview

The March Madness 2023 project aimed to provide insights into team performance and tournament dynamics through:

* **Data Visualization**: Interactive plots and charts to explore team statistics.
* **Statistical Heatmaps**: Visual representations of key performance metrics.
* **Bracket Research Tools**: Useful features to aid in bracket analysis, albeit without direct bracket simulation.

This project was built using Python, with key libraries including `pandas`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `streamlit` for the web interface.

## Key Features (2023)

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detailed visualizations of team statistics, such as scoring, rebounding, and shooting percentages.
* **Performance Heatmaps**: Visual representation of team performance across various metrics.
* **Streamlit Web Application**: An interactive web interface for exploring the data.

## Limitations (2023 vs. 2025)

* **No Bracket Simulation**: Unlike the [March Madness 2025](https://github.com/nehat312/march-madness-2025) project, this repository does not include a bracket simulation feature.
* **Basic Analytics**: The analytical capabilities are more rudimentary compared to the enhanced features in the 2025 version.
* **Maintenance**: This project is no longer actively maintained. For up-to-date features and improvements, please see the 2025 repository.

## Getting Started (Historical Context)

If you wish to explore the code and run the Streamlit application locally (for historical purposes), follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/nehat312/march-madness-2023.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/nehat312/march-madness-2023.git)
    cd march-madness-2023
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Streamlit app:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run NCAAB_MM_2023.py
    ```

5.  **Access the application in your browser.**
